# Iconit-v1.00
No longer ftp client needed to change PS4 icon games. this tool will do it for you .


#What I'm capable of?


This application is much convenient than uploading the images manually for many reasons :-

* This tool will take the game title and search for the CUSA type of the game from your system so you don't have to search CUSA of the game anymore 

################################################
* This tool will resize the images for you to the required size so you no longer need to use any applications or whatsoever to do that 

>> Not only that but it also count how many images are required for each game (icon) some games require only 2 images while others require more so no longer counting them by yourself it'll count and overwrite them roughly 0.35 second per image resizing included

################################################
* This tool will connect to your PS4 system through FTP directly so you no longer need FTP client applications such as FileZilla atleast not for changing the game icons

################################################
* This tool will work no matter how bad your speed connection minimum of 2kbps Upload and Download << The more speed you got the faster it'll perform >>

################################################
* I added a Folder that has lots of images for you to choose
from BUT DO DONT forget to copy the image you'd like to 
use to Upload folder first

Please help me develop the tool if you have any error report it @OfficialAhmed0
I will be updating the tool in order to make it much convenient and easy to use
and more importantly adding new features such as Change
profile icon ,save data icon etc.
I might create a Full application.

I tried to change the wallpaper of the games that show up when the game starts (named :pic1) however everytime I change
it a black screen shows up instead of the image I use .The
game starts just fine except the wallpaper any idea why?
you can try changing them through fileZilla if you can fix it
please DM me I will add it to the tool next update.

By the way thanks for reading.
