# Iconit
Latest version 4.01 (Aug 20, 2020)
No longer ftp client needed to change PS4 games icons. this tool will do it for you .

# About

This application is much convenient than uploading the images manually for many reasons :-

* This tool will take the game title and search for the CUSA type of the game from your system so you don't have to search CUSA of the game anymore 

################################################
* This tool will resize the images for you to the required size so you no longer need to use any applications or whatsoever to do that 

>> Not only that but it also count how many images are required for each game (icon) some games require only 2 images while others require more so no longer counting them by yourself it'll count and overwrite them roughly 0.35 second per image resizing included

################################################
* This tool will connect to your PS4 system through FTP directly so you no longer need FTP client applications such as FileZilla atleast not for changing the game icons

################################################
* This tool will work no matter how bad your speed connection minimum of 2kbps Upload and Download << The more speed you got the faster it'll perform >>

################################################
* I added a Library (Circlizeit.zip) that has lots of images for you to choose
from BUT DO DONT forget to copy the image you'd like to 
use to Uploadit folder first

###############################################
*In v4.01 added avatar icon changer feature

# Update v4.01

>(SSNE, MODS, LAPY, NP and more) as the Game ID.
>(Make sure to enable it under Settings>>Options)

I tried to change the wallpaper of the games that show up when the game starts (named :pic1) however everytime I change
it a black screen shows up instead of the image I use .The
game starts just fine except the wallpaper any idea why?
you can try changing them through fileZilla if you can fix it
please DM me I will add it to the tool next update.
