# About

This application is much convenient than uploading the images manually for many reasons :-

* This tool will take the game title and search for the CUSA type of the game from your system so you don't have to search CUSA of the game anymore 

* It'll resize the images for you to the required size so you no longer need to use any applications or whatsoever to do so. 

> Not only that but it also count how many images are required for each game (icon) some games require only 2 images while others require more, so no longer counting them by yourself it'll count and overwrite them.

* This tool will connect to your PS4 system through FTP directly so you no longer need FTP client applications such as FileZilla atleast not for changing the game icons or profile avatar.

* I added a Library (Circlizeit.zip) that has lots of images for you to choose from.

I tried to change the wallpaper of the games that show up when the game starts (named :pic1) however everytime I change
it a black screen shows up instead of the image I use .The
game starts just fine except the wallpaper any idea why?
you can try changing them through fileZilla if you managed to fix it
please DM me I will add it to the tool next update.
