# Update v4.72

* Ability to change any Homebrew (All homebrews will be detected format:LAPYxxxxx 4-letter prefix followed by 5-number suffix)  

* Ability to change System icons (ATTENTION: This will require extra permissions. Make sure to run FTP with Full R/W mode, Lapy Xplorer offer an option to allow FTP in "Danger mode" => Full R/W permissions by pressing (L2+Triangle). SomeTimes Xplorer seem to be allowing Full R/W but its not for some reason, try removing game data for Xplorer and retry) 

* Fixed major bug with caching (used to overwrite the cache meaning old cache is useless. Note: first time running the application might take awhile and may freeze wait for it. The 2nd time you run it would be ~99% faster)

* Game/Pic fully compatible with "GoldHen FTP" (The whole process rely on one connection now)

* Auto backup changed icons (stored in "Your Backup" folder)

* More accurate Game Titles (Less abbreviations shown as the Game title)

* Overall performance ++ (Implemented low-level Threading/multiprocessing)

* Better caching performance (used to Write/Read some data from/to Hard Disk now uses the RAM instead)

* Progress bar now shows realtime progression (used to be static and hard coded)

* Caching size reduced significantly

* Brand new User interface when connecting to PS4 (Modern design less memory usage)

* Fixed when using AvatarChange Error (No such file or directory: Pref.ini)

* Fixed noob algorithms to approach different problems (now the code is waaaaay much easier to read)

* Fixed when renaming PSN activated account Deactivates it (Recommended to use it on offline accounts. Use it on online accounts on your own risk this might need more attention as I don't have PSN activated accounts I can't test it, so I can't guarantee for activated accounts SORRY!)
